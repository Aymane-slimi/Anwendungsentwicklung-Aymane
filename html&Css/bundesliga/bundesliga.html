            <section class="s1"><h3>Jamie Gittens to play at FIFA Club World Cup with Borussia Dortmund, confirms Sebastian Kehl</h3><h4>Borussia Dortmund sporting director Sebastian Kehl has confirmed that Jamie Gittens will play for BVB at the FIFA Club World Cup, amidst interest from English Premier League side Chelsea.</h4>
                <p class="p">
Talks between the clubs about a possible transfer had been ongoing, but an agreement was not reached before the first summer transfer window deadline of 10 June.

Speaking to German broadcaster Sport1 on 11 June, Kehl revealed that Gittens will be part of Niko Kovač's squad for the Club World Cup. "There’s been contact with Chelsea, who approached us again yesterday. We had a phone call and 
spoke about our different expectations and perceptions. At the end of the day, it didn’t go any further because we have different perceptions about the player’s current value. But they were very respectful discussions," he said."It was all very respectful, but we’ve got different perceptions and a different
stance. We’re pleased Jamie will be part of our Club World Cup and that he’s staying here.The interest from Chelsea comes following a positive season from Gittens, with the 20-year-old scoring 12 goals and providing four assists across all competitions.

All in all, he has made 107 appearances for the Black-Yellows, scoring on 17 occasions. He currently has a contract that runs until 2028, with the last extension coming in 2023.

"We dealt with the approach seriously but made a decision for ourselves. It’s okay that Chelsea made an attempt.

"I spoke with Jamie before and after. Jamie is completely committed to Borussia Dortmund. He’s grown up here. The club has given him the opportunity to grow. We’re aware of his value for us, but it was a good discussion. Jamie’s excited about the Club World Cup and will give his all for the club." ...</p>

            <section  class="s1"><h3> Florian Wirtz: From budding youngster to Bundesliga superstar</h3><h4>Bayer Leverkusen's Florian Wirtz has come good on the potential he showed as a youngster to become one of the Bundesliga's top players and an established Germany international by the age of just 22.</h4>
                <p class="p">
                If you are ever arriving at Pulheim train station on the outskirts of Cologne, keep an eye out for the small sign proudly proclaiming: "Florian Wirtz's Hometown".

Deutsche Bahn, the state railway company, put similar symbols up all over Germany, pointing out to visitors during UEFA EURO 2024 where each of Julian Nagelsmann's squad had grown up.

Wirtz was actually born in the family home in the Brauweiler district of Pulheim - "that's how brave we were back then," said his father Hans-Joachim, whose youngest of 10 children entered the world on 3 May 2003. 

The age difference of over half-a-century between father and son - Wirtz's mother, Karin, is in her mid-60s - led to one TV reporter asking Florian whether his "grandma and grandpa" had come to see him play during the 2023/24 season. Wirtz, however, only sees the upsides of having his father as his agent and confidante.

"I know that he will never want something bad for me or will focus on money," Wirtz Jr explained of his father, who is now in his early 70s. "We have always had a good relationship. I have huge respect for my dad. I'm happy that I have an experienced man at my side who can advise me well." 

That guidance started at SV Grün-Weiss Brauweiler, where his dad remains a key figure on the club's board. His son's first coach, Wirtz Sr immediately saw something special. "Even then, as now, Florian had abilities that were different from those of the others," Hans-Joachim explained. "And he simply had fun with football and always had an eye for a better-positioned teammate."
For the trained locksmith, who later studied sports at the Cologne Sports University and became a special education teacher, fun was - and remains - the key for Florian. 

"It was always our desire that Florian have fun when playing football," Hans-Joachim explained. "That should continue to be the top priority, even if you now have to consider a few other things in your career. But fundamentally all the numbers are of no interest. He should have fun and play football well, and we as a family will of course enjoy that.”

With mum Karin a handball coach and his youngest sister Juliane also a footballer, Florian was surrounded by sport as a kid. "There are very few family members who have not played football," Wirtz explained. "There's always football on TV. In our family, a lot goes on around football."
That meant that when he soon had scouts from around the country hoping to swoop for him, his family helped decide the next step in the career of the then eight-year-old talent. 

"The family decided that we should try a year at Cologne, but it was tough to come to that decision," explained Hans-Joachim of the process that led to his son joining the Billy Goats' academy in 2011. “We also looked at Bayer Leverkusen and found a good situation there, but it was a pragmatic decision to go to Geißbockheim [N.B. Cologne's training centre] because the location was good.”

Geography dictated the move, but it would never have happened had Wirtz's father not also been involved in pushing it through. "The transfer period was actually over on 2 July, but as the youth academy director at Grün-Weiß, I could put the correct date on the paperwork." ...
